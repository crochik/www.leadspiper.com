In a land where cliffs met the sea, the Leads Piper played his bagpipes to guide lost leads through obstacles to conversion. His music stirred desires, leading them like sheep quickly to success. 
Through doubt, confusion, and indecision, his melody never faltered. At journey's end, in a meadow of success, leads became happy customers, thanks to the Piper's guidance.
